## About myself
I'm an engineer. During my free time I make sites with constructors such as Wix, Tilda and make sites with cms concrete5.
But my knowledge in developing powerfull and cool sites is weak. So, I wand to be a good front-end developer, that is why I started to learn courses in _RSSchool_

## My skills
HTML (html5), CSS (less, styl, BEM)
Git/GitHub
Figma, Zeplin, Photoshop

## Work experience
Not enought eprerience. I made some small sites with constructor,  but I don't think it's a useful experience
for front-end development

## Language
* Russian - native
* English - school and university education
